# VerosDS
This project has been written using the MVC pattern. To improve myself in the Viper pattern, I contacted the owner of this project, who is written in MVC, and obtained the necessary permissions. Afterward, I converted the project from MVC to VIPER. I will leave the link to the project in its MVC state.

Additionally, some minor modifications have been made to the code, but I haven't touched its main structure. It doesn't have any relation to me in terms of code quality.
